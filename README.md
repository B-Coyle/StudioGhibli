## Description



## Setup

Once you have cloned the repo, to install the library dependencies cd into the folders just created and run:

```bash
npm install
```

First in the back-end folder run `npm start` in your terminal, you should see "Something is running on http://localhost:3000/".  Now opening a separate tab in the terminal cd into the front-end repository and run `npm start` you're default browser should open a tab to http://localhost:3001/ if not simply go to http://localhost:3001/ in your preferred browser.
